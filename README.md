Modular and multilayered type design with CSS


I wanted to try some playful experiments that incorporated webfonts and CSS shenanigans. For this experiment, I wanted to create a webfont built from modular and geometric shapes (squares, triangles, half-circles, etc.) with the goal that one could layer the shapes on top of each other to produce recognizable (albeit abstract) letterforms. Additionally, I wanted to be able to gives the shapes color and a specific opacity so that layered together the letterforms would produce three distinct colors. AND, I wanted this presented in a screen-readable format so the text could be selectable and indexable.
